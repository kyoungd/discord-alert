this is a Chrome extension that automatically scrolls X/Twitter to reveal new tweets without manual page reloads.

  What it does:
  - Monitors your X/Twitter feed for new tweets using event-driven detection (MutationObserver)
  - Automatically scrolls to the top when fresh content appears
  - Works hands-free without polling or reloading the page
  - Can be toggled on/off via a popup
  - Runs entirely client-side with zero data collection

  Think of it as an auto-refresh utility that keeps your X/Twitter feed current without you having to manually reload or scroll.
